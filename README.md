# Login website API consumer
This is a basic API consumer website consisting of only a text field where if the user enters a number, the username with that user ID is displayed. The usage of API is required, as nothing in this website folder (including source code files) contains any info about list of registered users.

`login_website` folder and `login_website_API_consumer` folder must be placed in `C:\xampp\htdocs` (assuming you install XAMPP in the default location).
